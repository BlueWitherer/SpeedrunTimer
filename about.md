## About
This mod adds a speedrun timer in the style of the *[LiveSplit](https://www.livesplit.org/)* interface to the player's UI when playing a platformer level.

---

### Timer
A timer will appear on the top-right corner of the screen. It can be started and stopped via the `NumPad 1` key, and can be fully reset with `NumPad 3`. You can customize the keybinds via the *[Custom Keybinds](mod:geode.custom-keybinds)* mod.

By default, the timer will only appear when the player is playing on a platformer level. However, this can be changed in the settings.

### Splits
You can split your ongoing run into multiple segments by pressing `NumPad 2` while the timer is running. If the timer gets fully reset, any and all splits will be removed.

When reaching checkpoints, splits may be generated automatically. This can be changed in settings.
